Meow in an old inside joke from one of my old servers.  
This plugin let's the players use sugar as a drug and experience something similar to being high in Minecraft.  
The screen becomes blurry, you'll be able to jump really high and sprint quickly.

## Building locally
To build the project on your own do:
```BASH
mvn install
```
If successful, `target/Meow.jar` will be created. Move it to the `plugins` folder of your server and restart the server.
